# Reddit New UI Build 

This build is inspired with the new UI design of Reddit and I have tried to implement the subreddit and post logic in a simpler component architecture. It has reddit *0Auth* authentication and allows users to post under subreddit topics. It uses *graphql* queries and mutations to power the API

## Features
<ul>
    <li>It allows 0Auth authentication from Reddit using NextAuth.</li>
    <li>Allows users to explore the posts and top reddit communties.</li>
    <li>It allows users to post content and also comment on other posts.</li>
    <li>It also has upvote and downvote functionality on every post.</li>
</ul>

## Tools and Libraries used
<ul>
    <li>NextJS with Typescript</li>
    <li>NextAuth</li>
    <li>Postgresql</li>
    <li>Supabase</li>

</ul>
